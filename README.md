“Keep’n it Welly” is a website to promote local tourism. The website will also aim to help visitors navigate the city by providing them with the essential info required to have a successful trip/experience. This is a website for not only for visitors with a lot of time on their hands, but people are on quick weekend getaway with the family.

## Navigation Bar

The nav menu allows the user to move through the website and also have a visual representation as to which page they are currently on without having to guess.

## Footer

The footer bar holds social media links which when clicked on will take the user to “Keep’n it Welly” – Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or Instagram pages.

## Things to do page

In this section the user will be presented with some options on what to do in the city and also have additional useful links which will bring them to official sources of the desired activity.

## Getting around page

This page outlines info on how to navigate the city and displays some of the common transportation needs. Each section has links to external sources which are to help the user with some additional info for official sources.

## Contact us page

This page is for the user to provide a message and contact us for any additional requirements that they may have.

# Future Features

On the “Home” page, I want to include a video display in the background to make the site more visually appealing.

On the things to do page I would like to include an interactive map which will display areas in the city so that the user will have a visual indication as to the distance between popular destinations.

# Typography and colour scheme

The chosen style of the site is a clean display with strong contrast. I chose white on black for the text content as it stands out the most and is easy to read and then 100% strong vibrant colours for the navigation to clearly display where the user is on the website.
