                <h1>Getting Around</h1><br>
                <p>Arranging Wellington transport is fairly simple given its relatively small size compared to other world cities. Getting around still requires some planning, 
                but most destinations in the city are easy to get to.  During your stay, you’ll have a solid network of trains, buses and ferries to help you get from A to B. 
                Alternatively, you might like to hire a bicycle for navigating the city, or you may often find that where you want to go next is within easy walking distance anyway! 
                After all, this is a stunning city to explore on foot.</p><br>
                <p>Like every major city in the world, Wellington has its fair share of local taxis. Wellington taxis are the most direct way to get around if you're in a hurry or 
                you'd prefer transport that's more private. Thankfully, because the city isn't very large, fares remain quite reasonable for most trips. Ride-sharing companies 
                like Uber also operate in Wellington.</p><br>
                <p>Getting around on Wellington public transport is easy. Grab yourself a Metlink card from your nearest convenience store and top it up with prepaid credit as you 
                need to. Metlink cards give you access to the vast majority of public transport with one handy way to pay.</p><br>
                <p>Given its smaller size, walking Wellington is one of the best ways to see the city up close and at your own pace. If you're looking to stay fit while on holiday, 
                walking Wellington is one of the best ways to do so thanks to its hilly terrain – just remember to pack your best walking shoes!</p><br>
                <p>Jumping on a bike is another fantastic way to see Wellington at an unhurried pace. To use the Wellington bike hire service, just locate one of the city bike racks 
                around the city, rent one of the bikes currently parked there, and ride to your destination. Helmets are included free – just drop yours off when you arrive at the next 
                rack.</p>

                        <p>Transdev Wellington operates Metlink's five-line 154-kilometre (96 mi) commuter network, which fans north out of Wellington railway station as far as Waikanae in 
                        he north and Masterton in the east. Transdev Wellington operates the service under contract to the Greater Wellington Regional Council with rolling stock 
                        (except for diesel locomotives used on the Wairarapa services) owned by the council, and rail infrastructure owned by KiwiRail. Until 2016 KiwiRail division

                        <h2>Wellington Buses</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Wellington has an extensive network of bus routes. The routes are determined by the Regional Council, which regulates commercially provided services and solicits bids 
                        from private operators to run the services it is prepared to subsidise.
                        <br><br>
                        From July 2018, the largest operator is Tranzit Group, which provides services for most of Wellington City, the Hutt Valley, and the Wairarapa under the Tranzurban brand.
                        In Porirua and the Kapiti Coast most services are provided by Uzabus. Other bus providers in the region include Mana Coach Services (owner of Newlands Coach Services) 
                        which provides services in the northern suburbs and Tawa, and NZ Bus which provides services from Eastbourne and the east-west spine between Karori and Miramar.

                        <h2>Wellington Rentals</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Renting a car in New Zealand gives you several advantages over relying on public transportation. While buses go throughout much of the country, and the major cities 
                        are connected by trains and airports, going off the beaten track to experience New Zealand’s famous natural attractions—like the areas around Waipoua Forest and 
                        Milford Sound—requires your own vehicle.
                        <br><br>
                         Most of New Zealand is connected by roads that are paved and well-maintained; however, there are several gravel roads and off-road paths that travelers tend to take 
                        when exploring the outdoors. A car will be an acceptable rental option if you’re sticking to the cities, but for vast, rural areas and mountain passes, a four-by-four 
                        will be required, preferably with tire chains, which you can often add on to your reservation through companies like GO Rentals and JUCY.
                        <br><br>
                        According to the child restraint laws in New Zealand, your child must be secured in a car seat up until the age of seven. From seven to eight years old, they must be 
                        secured in a car seat if the vehicle has one already. From ages eight to 14, children must wear a seat belt if the vehicle is equipped with one; if not, the children 
                        must sit in the back of the vehicle.
                        <br><br>
                        A popular way to get around New Zealand is to rent a campervan, which are offered by most major rental companies in New Zealand, including Jucy and GO Rentals. 
                        A campervan not only often has four-by-four capabilities for off-roading, but they also allow visitors to camp out in nature and save money on accommodations during 
                        their time in New Zealand.

                        <h2>Wellington Airport</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Wellington Airport (formerly known as Rongotai Airport) is an international airport located in the suburb of Rongotai in Wellington. 
                        It is a hub for Air New Zealand and its subsidiaries. Wellington International Airport Limited, a joint venture between Infratil and the 
                        Wellington City Council, operates the airport.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The airport, in addition to linking many New Zealand destinations with national and regional carriers, also has links to major cities in 
                        eastern Australia. It is the home of some smaller general aviation businesses, including the Wellington Aero Club which operates from the 
                        general aviation area on the western side of the runway.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Wellington has a reputation for sometimes rough and turbulent landings, even in larger aircraft, due to the channelling effect of Cook Strait 
                        creating strong and gusty winds, especially in pre frontal north westerly conditions.
