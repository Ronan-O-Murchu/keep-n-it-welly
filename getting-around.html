                            <p>Wellington has an extensive network of bus routes. The routes are determined by the Regional Council, which regulates commercially provided services and solicits bids 
                            from private operators to run the services it is prepared to subsidise.
                            <br><br>
                            From July 2018, the largest operator is Tranzit Group, which provides services for most of Wellington City, the Hutt Valley, and the Wairarapa under the Tranzurban brand.
                            In Porirua and the Kapiti Coast most services are provided by Uzabus. Other bus providers in the region include Mana Coach Services (owner of Newlands Coach Services) 
                            which provides services in the northern suburbs and Tawa, and NZ Bus which provides services from Eastbourne and the east-west spine between Karori and Miramar.

                            <p>
                            Renting a car in New Zealand gives you several advantages over relying on public transportation. While buses go throughout much of the country, and the major cities 
                            are connected by trains and airports, going off the beaten track to experience New Zealand’s famous natural attractions—like the areas around Waipoua Forest and 
                            Milford Sound—requires your own vehicle.
                            <br><br>
                            Most of New Zealand is connected by roads that are paved and well-maintained; however, there are several gravel roads and off-road paths that travelers tend to take 
                            when exploring the outdoors. A car will be an acceptable rental option if you’re sticking to the cities, but for vast, rural areas and mountain passes, a four-by-four 
                            will be required, preferably with tire chains, which you can often add on to your reservation through companies like GO Rentals and JUCY.
                            <br><br>
                            According to the child restraint laws in New Zealand, your child must be secured in a car seat up until the age of seven. From seven to eight years old, they must be 
                            secured in a car seat if the vehicle has one already. From ages eight to 14, children must wear a seat belt if the vehicle is equipped with one; if not, the children 
                            must sit in the back of the vehicle.
                            <br><br>
                            A popular way to get around New Zealand is to rent a campervan, which are offered by most major rental companies in New Zealand, including Jucy and GO Rentals. 
                            A campervan not only often has four-by-four capabilities for off-roading, but they also allow visitors to camp out in nature and save money on accommodations during 
                            their time in New Zealand.

                            <h2>Wellington Airport</h2>
                            <br>
                            <p>TWellington Airport (formerly known as Rongotai Airport) is an international airport located in the suburb of Rongotai in Wellington. 
                                It is a hub for Air New Zealand and its subsidiaries. Wellington International Airport Limited, a joint venture between Infratil and the 
                                Wellington City Council, operates the airport.</p>
                                <br>
                            <p>The airport, in addition to linking many New Zealand destinations with national and regional carriers, also has links to major cities in 
                                eastern Australia. It is the home of some smaller general aviation businesses, including the Wellington Aero Club which operates from the 
                                general aviation area on the western side of the runway.</p>
                                <br>
                            <p>Wellington has a reputation for sometimes rough and turbulent landings, even in larger aircraft, due to the channelling effect of Cook Strait 
                                creating strong and gusty winds, especially in pre frontal north westerly conditions.
