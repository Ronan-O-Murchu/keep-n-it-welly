                            <p>Wellington has an extensive network of bus routes. The routes are determined by the Regional Council, which regulates commercially provided services and solicits bids

                            From July 2018, the largest operator is Tranzit Group, which provides services for most of Wellington City, the Hutt Valley, and the Wairarapa under the Tranzurban brand.
                            In Porirua and the Kapiti Coast most services are provided by Uzabus. Other bus providers in the region include Mana Coach Services (owner of Newlands Coach Services)

                                Requirements for cars; many backpackers go for a station wagon as they are planning to sleep in it to save money on accommodation. Before you do this, 
                                remember: New Zealand has an excellent network of inexpensive hostels and campsites, and also one major crime problem: theft from cars. A 'saloon' with 
                                a secure boot which hides all your possessions will be much safer for your kit. Also be aware that hostel owners don't generally like you sleeping in the 
                                car outside and expecting to use the hostel showers etc, as this will overload the place.

                            <p>TWellington Airport (formerly known as Rongotai Airport) is an international airport located in the suburb of Rongotai in Wellington. 
                                It is a hub for Air New Zealand and its subsidiaries. Wellington International Airport Limited, a joint venture between Infratil and the 
                                Wellington City Council, operates the airport.</p>
                                <br>
                            <p>The airport, in addition to linking many New Zealand destinations with national and regional carriers, also has links to major cities in 
                                eastern Australia. It is the home of some smaller general aviation businesses, including the Wellington Aero Club which operates from the 
                                general aviation area on the western side of the runway.</p>
                                <br>
                            <p>Wellington has a reputation for sometimes rough and turbulent landings, even in larger aircraft, due to the channelling effect of Cook Strait 
                                creating strong and gusty winds, especially in pre frontal north westerly conditions.
