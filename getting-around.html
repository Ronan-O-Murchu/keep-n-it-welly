                            <p>Te Papa has a mixture of long term exhibitions of cultural objects, hands-on and interactive exhibitions, cultural spaces and touring exhibitions.
                                The long term exhibitions of cultural objects focus on New Zealand history, M훮ori culture and New Zealand's natural world.
                                The hands-on and interactive exhibitions focus on engaging particularly young visitors and include both indoor areas and out-door areas built and planted for the purpose.
                                The key cultural space is the Te Hono ki Hawaiki marae with very impressive whakairo.[53]
                                All permanent exhibitions are free. Many of the touring exhibition are ticketed, but there are occasional free days.</p>
