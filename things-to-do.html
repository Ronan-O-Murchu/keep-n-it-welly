                        The long term exhibitions of cultural objects focus on New Zealand history, Māori culture and New Zealand's natural world.
                        The hands-on and interactive exhibitions focus on engaging particularly young visitors and include both indoor areas and out-door areas built and planted for the purpose.
                        The key cultural space is the Te Hono ki Hawaiki marae with very impressive whakairo.
                        All permanent exhibitions are free. Many of the touring exhibition are ticketed, but there are occasional free days.

                    <p class="things-to-do-text">Zealandia, formerly known as the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary, is a protected natural area in Wellington, New Zealand, the first urban completely 
                    fenced ecosanctuary, where the biodiversity of 225 ha (just under a square mile) of forest is being restored. The sanctuary was previously part of the water catchment 
                    area for Wellington, between Wrights Hill (bordering Karori) and the Brooklyn wind turbine on Polhill. 
                    <br><br>Most of New Zealand's ecosystems have been severely modified by the introduction of land mammals that were not present during the evolution of its ecosystems, and have had a 
                    devastating impact on both native flora and fauna. The sanctuary, surrounded by a pest-exclusion fence, is a good example of an ecological island, which allows the original natural 
                    ecosystems to recover by minimising the impact of introduced flora and flora.
                    <br><br>The sanctuary has become a significant tourist attraction in Wellington and is responsible for the greatly increased number of sightings of species such as tui and kākā in city's suburbs.
